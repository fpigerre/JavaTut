    /*
    * Welcome to Java!
    *
    * Java is an Object Orientated programming language.
    * Objects are the key to understanding object-oriented technology.
    * Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.
    *
    * Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior.
    * Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail).
    * Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes).
    * Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.
    *
    * Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior.
    * An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages).
    * Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
    * Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

    * Things to know before starting:
    *
    * This is a comment. These words are ignored by the program when it is compiled.
    *
    * Anything between /* is a multiple line comment.
    * Anything with // before it is a single line comment.
    *
    * While browsing the project, you may find notations similar to this:
    * @Information io.github.psgs.javatut.java.Introduction.java;
    * If you look at the class defined in this notation, you will find more information about the subject the notation is about.

    /*
    * What is a Class?
    *
    * A class is a file that Java code is stored in.
    * It can often be thought of as a blueprint from which individual objects are created.
    *
    * For more information about classes, see the Bicycle class.
     */

    /*
    * What is a Package?
    *
    * A package is a directory a class can be stored in.
    * Packages must follow a specific java naming convention.
    * Packages can often be seen as 'back to front' websites.
    *
    * An example of a package, would be 'com.example.exampleproject'.
    * When creating a package, you can use a website, a subdomain, or even an email address, although the first two are preferred.
    * When creating a package using a website, it is recommended you own the website, or have significant access to it.

    /**
    * What is Inheritance?
    *
    * Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other.
    * Mountain bikes, road bikes, and tandem bikes, for example, all share the characteristics of bicycles (current speed, current pedal cadence, current gear).
    * Yet each also defines additional features that make them different: tandem bicycles have two seats and two sets of handlebars; road bikes have drop handlebars; some mountain bikes have an additional chain ring, giving them a lower gear ratio.
    *
    * Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.
    * In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.
